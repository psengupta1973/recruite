		"We manage what our clients call their prime asset : <b>People</b>."<P>
		We follow a simple rule: don’t send raw candidates which would be a waste of time for the clients. Having known the needs of our  clients, we conduct a psychometric test to screen candidates at our place before packing them off for the final interview. Our test is, well, difficult, to say the least. Experts at the job have spent hours in designing a questionnaire which sizes up a candidate in totality. Only those who get through are given the training and made to appear in the interview.
		<P>
		For the most part, our course are designed to be interactive which not only help them to learn but also develop a broader outlook by mingling with others and imbibe the team spirit which is of primary importance at a workplace. Here we do not act as man managers but as managers of people. This attitude has enabled us to get under the skin of each candidate and prepare him according to the prescribed needs of our clients.
